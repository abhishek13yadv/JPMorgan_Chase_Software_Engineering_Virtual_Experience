# JPMorgan_Chase_Software_Engineering_Virtual_Experience

JPMorgan Chase has traders in all the major financial centers and creates a marketplace for asset classes around the globe for our investor clients. Trading teams are organized by asset class:

<ul>
 <li>Equities (stocks)</li>
 <li>Commodities</li>
 <li>Credit (debt and bonds)</li>
 <li>Currency & Emerging Markets</li>
 <li>Public Finance (Government bonds)</li>
 <li>Interest rates</li>
 <li>Securitized Products</li>
</ul>

For this project, a trader from the equities team (publicly listed company stocks) has requested functionality be added to their dashboard to allow them to input specific information so they can monitor a new trading strategy.

In order to do this, I set up my system to interface with the relevant financial data feed, make the required calculations and then present this in a way that allows the traders to visualize and analyze this data in real time.

The visualization of charts and data analysis our trader’s see is all built on JPMorgan Chase's own open sourced software called Perspective. I learnt how to implement this to facilitate the trader’s requested changes and deliver actionable insights.

I gained an understanding of the user requirements and then build something that meets those requirements.
